Mini Project 1

You are provided a ‘real-world’ dataset (MiniProject1.csv also see Figure 1) that is posted on the Teams
Channel (Goto Files). You are required to perform the following tasks:

1) Fit a logistic regression model by selecting between 4 – 6 Inputs from the variables provided. Your Output Variable is the bridge condition (which is binary).
      ◦ Highlight one or two papers to guide your feature (input) selection for the logistic regression model.
      ◦ You will have to write a program and solve the unconstrained optimization model for the binary regression using the Newton’s Method. You can make use of the Numerical         Jacobian and Hessian Functions.
      ◦ Write a program to solve the optimization model using Nelder-Mead method using available Python functions

2) Write a program to develop the 95% Confidence Levels for each of the estimated Model Coefficient of the Logistic Regression Model using the Bootstrap Approach
      ◦ Hint: You can resample the dataset (with replacement) (say 5000 times) perform the regression for each resampled dataset using Nelder-Mead and store the coefficients.         You can then obtain the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile to obtain the confidence intervals.


Please summarize all your results appropriately using Table and Figures. Make sure you present a workflow (either as a list of steps, flowchart or pseudocode) for all the programs you write. Remember the focus of this class is on optimization methods and not the results per se. So presenting the logic behind the code is important.
